Iâ€™m developing a **cycling speed and cadence sensor** using a custom PCB with the following components:

* **NRF52810-QCAA-R7** â€“ ANT+ capable SoC
* **LSM6DS3TR** â€“ 6-axis IMU (accelerometer + gyroscope)
* **LIS3MDL** â€“ 3-axis magnetometer

I'm using **VS Code** for development and the **nRF5 SDK** (not Zephyr). The device will communicate using the **ANT+ protocol only** â€” BLE is not required.

Please assist with the following:

---

### 1. Define the project structure

Propose a clean, modular, and scalable C firmware project layout for the **nRF5 SDK**, designed for use in **VS Code**. Include explanations for each folder/file and suggest a build system compatible with the SDK.

---

### 2. Generate a basic firmware template (C code)

Create an initial firmware skeleton that includes:

* System and clock initialization for NRF52810
* SPI/I2C setup for LSM6DS3TR and LIS3MDL
* ANT+ broadcasting (Cycling Speed and Cadence Profile)
* Modular code with comments for easy scaling

---

### 3. Integrate advanced functionality

Include the following design considerations and hooks (do not implement fully yet):

* ðŸ”‹ **Power management**:

  * Sleep modes (System ON/OFF)
  * Sensor power control (via GPIO)
  * Wake on motion or timer

* ðŸ§¾ **Logging**:

  * Optional debug logging via RTT or UART
  * Configurable log levels (info/warning/error)

* ðŸ§  **Sensor fusion algorithms**:

  * Structure for integrating sensor fusion (e.g., for wheel RPM vs crank RPM)
  * Use of accelerometer + gyroscope for cadence estimation
  * Optional magnetometer integration for heading or motion validation

---

### 4. Documentation / Wiki structure

Suggest a documentation structure (e.g., GitHub Wiki) with sections for:

* Project overview
* Hardware description
* Firmware modules
* ANT+ communication
* Sensor interfacing (IMU + magnetometer)
* Sensor fusion design
* Power management
* Logging and debug
* Build and flashing guide
* Known issues and troubleshooting

---

### 5. Firmware flashing instructions (J-Link)

Provide step-by-step documentation to:

* Connect J-Link over SWD
* Install required tools (nRF Command Line Tools, SEGGER J-Link)
* Flash `.hex` or `.bin` files via command line or integrate with VS Code
* Verify success and debug via RTT or UART

---

### 6. Search and summarize real-world examples

Find existing **open-source projects** that implement:

* Cycling speed/cadence sensors
* ANT+ protocol using NRF5 SDK (especially for NRF52810)
* Use of IMUs or magnetometers (especially LSM6DS3TR or LIS3MDL)
* Bonus: Projects with power management, logging, or sensor fusion

Summarize their relevance, structure, and features.
